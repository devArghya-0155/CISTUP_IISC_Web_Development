To run this project, download the project and open it in your code editor.
Open up your terminal and run **npm install** to install all the necessary dependencies required in the frontend.
To run the backend part, you must have **flask, flask_cors, ultralytics and opencv installed**.
In your terminal type - 
pip install flask
pip install flask_cors
pip install ultralytics
pip install opencv-python

Use **npm run dev** to load the front end.
cd over to the flask folder and run **python "server.py"** to load the backend

The project should run fine now on **http://localhost:5173/**
